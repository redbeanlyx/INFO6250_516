[PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

** All the details of our final project are included in our report

at the begining of our report, we extract some basic and import information from the description which the professor gave us in the blackboard

after that we explain every details with charts and screenshots
